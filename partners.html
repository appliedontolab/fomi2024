<p><b>What is OntoCommons?</b>

<p><a href="https://ontocommons.eu/" target="_blank">OntoCommons</a> is an H2020 CSA project dedicated to the standardisation of data documentation across all domains related to materials and manufacturing.

<p>OntoCommons lays the foundation for interoperable, harmonised and standardised data documentation through ontologies, facilitating data sharing and pushing data-driven innovation, to bring out a truly Digital Single Market and new business models for European industry, exploit the opportunities of digitalisation and address sustainability challenges.

<p><b>How?</b>
<p>By developing the Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) - a set of ontologies and tools that follows specific standardisation rules - and provide a sustainable approach, making the data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). Moreover, the OCES implements practical and user-friendly mechanisms of intra- and cross-domain interoperability focusing on materials and manufacturing sectors.

<p>This will be achieved by coordinating a wide range of EU stakeholders and with the support of Demonstration Cases with strong industrial involvement, covering a wide range of NMBP (Nanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology, and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing) application domains.

<p><b>Who is behind OntoCommons?</b>
<p>OntoCommons represents relevant stakeholder knowledge by bringing together a <a href="https://ontocommons.eu/partners" target="_blank">consortium</a> from a wide range of communities including subject matter experts (e.g. material scientists), ontologists (e.g. philosophers, semantic web experts), implementers (e.g. database experts), industrial end users (e.g. manufacturers), and application developers.
<p> You can join the OntoCommons community as a <a href="https://www.ontocommons.eu/user/register" target="_blank">User</a> or <a href="https://ontocommons.eu/register/expert" target="_blank">Expert Stakeholder</a>.

<p><b>Mission statement</b>
<p>The mission of <a href="https://www.industrialontologies.org/" target="_blank">IOF</a> is to create a set of core and open reference ontologies that spans the entire domain of digital manufacturing. 
The IOF will work with Government, Industry, Academic and Standards organizations to advance data interoperability in their respective fields. 

<p><b>Technical goals</b>
<p>Creating a suite of open and principles-based reference ontologies, from which other domain dependent or application ontologies can be derived in a modular fashion, remaining 'generic' (i.e., non-proprietary, non-implementation specific) so they can be reused in any number of industrial domains or manufacturing specializations.
<p>Providing principles and best practices by which quality ontologies can be developed that will support interoperability for industrial domains.
<p>Instituting a governance mechanism to maintain and promulgate the goals and principles.
<p>Providing an organizational framework and governance processes that ensure conformance to principles and best practices for development, sharing, maintenance, evolution, and documentation of IOF ontologies.

<p><b>Who is involved?</b>
<p>IOF membership is open to all. Please go to the <a href="https://www.industrialontologies.org/participation-request/" target="_blank"> participation page </a> for more details. -->
